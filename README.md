# CC-tema2 - Creating a REST API

Homework 2 - Create an application that provides a RESTFull API. Observation: It is mandatory to use at least: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, as described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer .

The use of any kind of framework was prohibited.
Personal obs: messy code, could use some (a lot of) refactoring.
